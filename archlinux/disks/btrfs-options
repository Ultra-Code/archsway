# BTRFS Filesystem Options
*options for btrfs :NOTE make sure to to update kernel to the latest before you
    do any modifications to the options under
*read intensive work-loads, specifying noatime significantly improves performance
    because no new access time information needs to be written.
:noatime
    Enable automatic file defragmentation. When enabled, small random writes into files
    (in a range of tens of kilobytes, currently itâ€™s 64K) are detected and queued up for
    the defragmentation process. Not well suited for large database workloads.
    The read latency may increase due to reading the adjacent blocks that make up the range
    for defragmentation, successive write will merge the blocks in the new location.
:autodefrag
    Control BTRFS file data compression:compression options are zlib,zstd and lzo
    Both zlib and zstd (since version 5.1) expose the compression level as a tunable
    knob with higher levels trading speed and memory (zstd) for higher compression ratios
    Zlib accepts the range [1, 9] and zstd accepts [1, 15]. If no level is set, both
    currently use a default level of 3.NOTE:level 1-3 is recommended since higher usually use
    more resource withut any significantly increase in compression
:compress=zstd:1
    Set the interval of periodic transaction commit when data are synchronized to permanent storage
:commit=240
    The free space cache greatly improves performance when reading block group free
    space into memory
:space_cache=v2
